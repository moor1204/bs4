# Beautiful Soup Tutorial

###Beautiful Soup is a python library for scraping html pages.


Why use Beautiful Soup:

1. Extract information from a webpage to put into Excel, a Word document, a dataframe, or a database
2. Gather hard-to-format information without copying and pasting individual elements
3. Use to extract urls for other uses (maybe build your own webcrawler!)
